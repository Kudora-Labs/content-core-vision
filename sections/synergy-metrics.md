# Synergy & Metrics

> *What we measure becomes what we amplify.*

Kudora introduces **new core metrics** that reflect health, coordination quality, and ethical integrity — moving beyond vanity indicators.

---

## Metric Philosophy
Legacy metrics (TPS, TVL, raw addresses) are *necessary but insufficient*. Kudora tracks **coordination efficiency**, **human authenticity**, and **recognition equity**.

---

## Core Metric Set
| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Activation Rate | % of new builders earning first Kudos < 72h | Measures onboarding + meaningful first engagement |
| Recognition Velocity | Median time from first contribution → governance threshold | Indicates acceleration of contributor empowerment |
| Contribution Yield | % of inflation routed to active contributors vs passive | Validates incentive inversion |
| Signal Density | Curated opportunities / total inbound submissions | Health of noise filtration |
| Synergy Index | Avg frameworks leveraged per launched project | Reuse & composability strength |
| Reuse Multiplier | (# of downstream adoptions of an artifact) / (original contributor count) | Measures compounding effect |
| Trust Integrity | Ratio of verified human contributors / total active addresses | Bot resistance & authenticity |
| Ethical Alignment Score | Weighted compliance with EthicDAO guidelines across active projects | Cultural coherence |
| Retention Half-Life | Time for 50% of a cohort to remain active post-onboarding | Stickiness & value resonance |
| Governance Participation Quality | % of proposals with > X diversified reputational quorum | Depth over superficial votes |
| Coordination Latency | Avg time from mission proposal → first accepted contribution | Ecosystem responsiveness |
| Failure Recycling Rate | % of “failed” missions whose assets are reused in later launches | Learning efficiency |

---

## Metric Layers
1. **Public Dashboard** – High-level ecosystem pulse (updated daily/weekly).
2. **Contributor Console** – Personalized progression + suggestions.
3. **Governance Lens** – Alignment + risk alerts (ethics, concentration, attrition).
4. **External Trust Portal** – Investor / partner facing legitimacy dataset.

---

## Anti-Metric Gaming Safeguards
- Median + distributional views (not just averages).
- Multi-signal composites (e.g., Recognition Velocity excludes bot-flagged addresses).
- Dynamic anomaly detection → manual review routes.
- Transparent metric formulas (open spec) to build trust.

---

## Narrative Use
These metrics tell an external audience:
- *This ecosystem knows what progress actually looks like.*
- *It can detect decay early.*
- *It compounds knowledge; failure isn't waste.*

---

## Early Public Targets (Illustrative)
(Real targets will be finalized post initial cohort sizing.)
- Activation Rate > 55%
- Recognition Velocity < 14 days
- Contribution Yield > 60%
- Trust Integrity > 90%
- Synergy Index ≥ 3 frameworks / project (after quarter 2)
