# Frameworks: Acceleration-as-Infrastructure

> *Frameworks, not features — because the world needs services, not demos.*

Kudora's **Framework Layer** converts abstract potential into *deployable, composable building blocks* that dramatically shrink time-to-impact. Instead of leaving every project to reinvent onboarding, compliance heuristics, identity flows, trust verification, or incentive scaffolds — Kudora ships *evolutionary templates*.

---

## Purpose of the Framework Layer
- **Reduce Friction**: Lower cognitive + operational overhead for new builders.
- **Increase Consistency**: Shared primitives → interoperable services → faster synergy.
- **Amplify Reuse**: Every refinement benefits all downstream adopters.
- **Encode Ethics**: Guardrails and best practices embedded from version 1.

## Framework Categories (Initial Wave)
| Category | Problem Solved | Example Components |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Micro-Governance | Fragmented DAO design | Proposal templates, quorum heuristics, escalation paths |
| Local Economy | Hard bootstrapping of community markets | Token schema, reputation gating, micro-grant flows |
| Education Track | Onboarding inefficiency | Learning path maps, credential badges, progression missions |
| Energy / Resource | Local utility coordination | Metering adapters, pricing curve templates, settlement logic |
| Reputation & Identity | Trust fragmentation | DID adapters, endorsement modules, decay logic |
| Contribution Missions | Ad hoc task chaos | Mission spec DSL, reward routing, review workflows |

## Lifecycle of a Framework
1. **Origin Draft** – Crafted by a cross-domain mission (builders + experts + ethic stewards).
2. **Alpha Adoption** – Piloted by 1–2 aligned projects; telemetry captured.
3. **Refinement Cycle** – Feedback-driven iteration; ethical + security audits.
4. **General Release** – Indexed in the Framework Registry; open for ecosystem use.
5. **Evolution Governance** – Proposed updates flow through EthicDAO + domain councils.

---

## Embedded Ethical Guardrails
- **Default Transparency Hooks** (usage stats opt-in prompts).
- **Abuse Prevention Patterns** (rate limits, moderation slots, escalation triggers).
- **Inclusion Levers** (multi-language scaffolds, accessibility baseline patterns).
- **Data Minimization** (privacy-first identity flows). 

---

## Reuse Telemetry (Synergy Signal)
Tracked per framework:
- Active deployments
- Contribution delta (added modules / quarter)
- Dependency depth (avg frameworks per project)
- Issue resolution time
- Ethical compliance score (auto + peer weighting)

---

## Psychological Impact on Builders
- **Momentum**: Early wins accelerate commitment.
- **Belonging**: Shared primitives create cultural and technical cohesion.
- **Mastery Path**: Contributors can specialize in framework stewardship.

## Example Launch Journey (90-Minute Startup)
1. Pick *Local Economy Framework* → configure parameters (scope, roles, token policy).  
2. Attach *Reputation & Identity Module* → set recognition thresholds for participation.  
3. Enable *Micro-Governance* → install default proposal schema.  
4. Publish v0 → immediate mission posting + recognition routing.  
5. Iterate using real-time telemetry dashboard.
