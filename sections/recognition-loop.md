# The Recognition Loop

> *Recognition → Reputation → Influence → Coordination → Impact → More Recognition.*

The **Recognition Loop** is Kudora's fundamental flywheel. It transforms isolated effort into compounding ecosystem acceleration.

---

## Loop Overview
1. **Contribution** – A builder ships code, designs an interface, writes a primer, audits a contract, mentors a newcomer.
2. **Verification & Attribution** – Automated + peer mechanisms confirm authenticity, relevance, originality.
3. **Recognition (Kudos)** – Minted / allocated proportional to validated contribution signals.
4. **Reputation Graph Update** – Node + edge weights adjust (who worked with whom, in what domain, with what reuse).
5. **Influence & Access** – Elevated governance relevance, curated mission invitations, deeper framework permissions.
6. **Improved Coordination** – Better matching → fewer misaligned efforts → reduced duplication.
7. **Higher Impact Output** – Faster growth in shared framework + service layer.
8. **Reinforced Trust** – External entrants see credible, legible history; they join faster.

Loop tightens as friction declines and attribution fidelity increases.

## Attribution System Layers
| Layer | Purpose | Tools / Signals |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Automated Scan | Detect raw events | Commits, merges, PR metadata |
| Semantic Classification | Categorize value type | NLP tagging (education, infra, governance) |
| Peer Validation | Human qualitative weight | Endorsements, review scoring |
| Reuse Tracking | Downstream utility | Dependency graph, citation mapping |
| Integrity Filters | Detect anomalies | Time-series deviation, cluster analysis |

## Preventing Recognition Gaming
- **Diminishing Marginal Returns** on rapid low-impact micro-spam.
- **Cross-Domain Multiplier** offsets specialization spam; rewards *breadth + depth* balance.
- **Temporal Smoothing** reduces burst farming.
- **Peer Confidence Weighting**: Low-trust endorsers carry less validation power.
- **Adaptive Risk Flags**: Suspicious score patterns route to targeted human review.

---

## Reputation Graph Characteristics
- **Directional**: Who endorses whom; not all recognition is reciprocal.
- **Composable**: Projects can query domain-specific subgraphs.
- **Portable**: Reputation persists across forks, mergers, pivots.
- **Auditable**: Every edge traceable to underlying contribution events.

---

## Psychological Design
- **Visible Progress**: Builders see their evolving graph nodes and influence zones.
- **Status Earned, Not Bought**: Prevents wealth-based status mimicry.
- **Collective Pride**: Public reuse metrics signal ecosystem health.
- **Belonging Through Proof of Work Ethic**: Identity anchored in craft + reliability.

## Example Micro-Journey
- Day 1: Designer improves onboarding flow (PR merged) → initial Kudos.
- Week 2: Flow adopted by 4 projects → reuse multiplier triggers bonus.
- Month 1: Designer joins governance deliberations; voting weight unlocked.
- Month 3: Invited to co-lead framework refinement mission → accelerated influence.

## Why This Matters Externally
Investors, partners, and ecosystem integrators gain a *transparent talent and trust index*—reducing due diligence time and increasing conviction.

> *The Recognition Loop converts effort into enduring legitimacy — the rarest asset in an age of synthetic output.*
